/**
 * 2. Purely Functional Sets.
 * A trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by mixing
 * them into classes. Unlike class inheritance, in which each class must inherit from just
 * one superclass, a class can mix in any number of traits.
 *
 * Traits are used to define object types by specifying the signature of the supported
 * methods. Scala also allows traits to be partially implemented but traits may not have
 * constructor parameters.
 *
 * A trait definition looks just like a class definition except that it uses the keyword
 * trait. The following is the basic example syntax of trait.
